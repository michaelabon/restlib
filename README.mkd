# RESTLib

This service is designed to help your code interact with a RESTful server.
To use, simply add these three lines to your project:

    import restlib
    rest_service = restlib.RestService('www.example.com')
    json_obj = rest_service.request_get('/resource/on/server')

RESTLib supports GET and PUT on both HTTP and HTTPS.
